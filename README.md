# inverter
This is a program I use to run a module I developed that operates a solar panel to obtain maximum power at given conditions by varying solar output voltage. The module uses a synchronous buck converter setup. The code can operate the module as power supply unit and also other charging algorithms like constant current or constant voltage. The module has 2 battery /pack connection which can be arranged automatically in parallel or series connection the code operates this functionality. Based on the solar panel voltage the code is made to enable charging the batteries in both of these configurations.
The module has a single phase inverter with a H MOSFET configuration. The code operates this inverter using ledc esp32 to write pwm to obtain inverting action. It also has an active feedback arrangement which enables the program to calculate and attempt to correct any deviation of the result ac signal from a perfect sine wave form.
